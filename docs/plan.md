## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the habiTv project, a video downloader and manager that supports multiple platforms and formats. The plan is based on an analysis of the current state of the project, its architecture, and the roadmap outlined in existing documentation.

The improvement plan focuses on several key areas: technical architecture, security, user experience, plugin ecosystem, performance, and documentation. Each area includes specific recommendations with rationales and implementation approaches.

## Goals and Constraints

### Key Goals

1. **Enhance Security**: Strengthen the security posture of the application, particularly around plugin management and network communications.
2. **Improve User Experience**: Modernize the user interface and enhance usability for both casual and power users.
3. **Expand Plugin Ecosystem**: Create a more robust plugin system with better development tools and distribution mechanisms.
4. **Optimize Performance**: Improve download speeds, reduce memory usage, and enhance overall application responsiveness.
5. **Strengthen Community**: Build a stronger community around the project through better documentation, contribution guidelines, and communication channels.
6. **Ensure Maintainability**: Reduce technical debt and improve code quality to ensure long-term maintainability.

### Constraints

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing plugins and configurations.
2. **Java 8 Support**: Continue supporting Java 8 as the minimum required version.

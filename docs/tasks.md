  - Test common user workflows
  - Rationale: Ensures the user interface works correctly

- [ ] **Add performance tests**
  - Create benchmarks for critical operations
  - Test with large numbers of episodes and categories
  - Rationale: Identifies performance bottlenecks

- [ ] **Implement test fixtures and mocks**
  - Create reusable test fixtures for common test scenarios
  - Use mocking frameworks for external dependencies
  - Rationale: Makes tests more maintainable and focused

## 4. Documentation Improvements

- [ ] **Create comprehensive JavaDoc**
